                    Marriage celebrants are unable to advertise any fee that may be
                    charged, as it can be considered price-fixing by the Government.
                    Her fee is about average in the wider Canterbury region. The
                    feedback she has received from couples is that what is offered by
                    Angie in her role is great value for their monetary outlay.
                    Living locally also means no travel fee is required should you

                    Angie has a strong belief that both weddings and funerals are
                    expressions of love - though of course, the words and emotions
                    may reflect the love differently at a funeral.</p>

                    Celebrant' the same thing? The answer to this is 'no'. The
                    Director is the person (usually from a Funeral Company) who
                    takes care of the more practical side of death - taking care of the
                    body, setting.</p>
                    
                    <p class="white-p paragraph-margin">Angie would be honoured to guide you as you farewell a loved

                    <p class="white-p paragraph-margin">Most importantly, as a Funeral Celebrant, Angie brings her
                    compassion, wisdom and experience when guiding you through
                    the funeral service itself.</p>
                    
                    <p class="white-p paragraph-margin">Every farewell is different for every individual is unique. Angie will
                    gently guide you, with understanding and care, so that together,
                    we create a service that honours your loved one, and that you will
                    remember with love.</p>

The care to know us all and diversity to adjust to all types really helped settle our guests. Angie helped organize all facets of the day, not only being an amazing celebrant, but also seating and calming friends and family members, to MC'ing our speeches at the reception! An amazing lady who cares for all involved, which makes for the best day you could ever want. 🥰

I have attended many weddings over the years and I admit to nearly falling asleep from time to time. No chance with Angie! She skillfully brought us all together with her wit and humour.  I cannot recommend her highly enough.

Angie's communication and professionalism is top notch and makes for the best wedding day you could wish for. Our wedding day was faultless and we all had the most amazing time. Mel and I and our family and friends all have some very special memories from this beautiful day that Angie helped make such a success.

                                    We spent a lot of time thinking about how to write this review as it is so difficult to put into words how wonderful Angie is. <br>
                                    Due to COVID (which interrupted our initial plans) and some sooner than expected medical treatment, we decided to be married in NZ and gave ourselves six weeks to organise the wedding (to be held the weekend before Christmas!). Angie was recommended to us so we reached out to her. She was excited and supportive of our plans - not once did we feel like we were out of our depth or ambitious for planning a wedding in six weeks. This is important, as we credit our vendors (including Angie) for helping us keep cool heads during what some have described as one of the most stressful times of their lives. <br>
                                    Right from the beginning Angie went above and beyond. Her communication was excellent, she was always willing to work into our busy schedules and planning it all was all just so easy and really enjoyable! The day of the wedding Angie was just amazing, she made sure everything went smoothly, organised everyone and managed our family dynamics so well. The ceremony Angie put together for us was beautiful, it was exactly what we could have hoped for. All of our guests told us how lucky we were to have Angie there and we absolutely agree, we wouldn't change a thing about the day. 
                                    Thank you Ange, from the bottom of our hearts - our day was that much better for having you be a part of it and we are so grateful for you.
                                </p>

                                    I would like to thank you Angie for making our day the best it could ever be. Not only were you an exceptional celebrant, coordinating the ceremony and making sure everything ran smoothly but also making family and friends comfortable and relaxed the entire time. Angie is much more than a celebrant, she is also a vibrant, bubbly and warm personality that instantly puts everyone she meets at ease. Her enthusiastic and personal approach really shines through while working with the people she is marrying and extended guests, you can definitely see that she “loves love”. Angie also made life a lot easier after the ceremony at the reception, taking to the microphone and announcing us as we arrived. She is an articulate, perfectionist with an easy going but well organised approach. Let's just say, she definitely knows what she is doing. I cannot thank, praise or speak highly enough of her and her approach to being a celebrant/MC. If whoever is reading this is thinking of marrying, do not miss out on Angie Mack Unlimited... she really is unlimited xox thanks again Angie.

                                    We had the privilege of having Angie conduct our marriage ceremony for our wedding two days ago. She is such a beautiful and warm person and really took the time to get to know our guests. The actual ceremony she put together had the perfect amount of humour on our important day. If you are even considering anyone else don't! The little extra things she does like check what the bridesmaids and mum and mum-in-law are wearing so she doesn't wear a clashing colour make all the difference! Thank you xx Holly and Phill.

                                    Angie was incredible... having her as our celebrant for our wedding ceremony could not have been a better experience. We felt very lucky. Right from the start she was laid-back (like chatting with an old friend!), attentive to our needs and wishes, very enthusiastic about love, and her recommendations were always spot on.<br>
                                    We gave her an idea of the outdoor environment we'd like to get married in, she nailed it the first time. We told her we wanted to do something special and symbolic to include our 11-month old son, she suggested we plant a tree together after the ceremony. And the list goes on... Honestly in so many ways, we just felt like she “got us,” and this after meeting by FaceTime only two or three times (we are from Canada) and once in person the day before our wedding, as well as a few email exchanges. She was flexible, super relaxed and everything just went so smoothly the day of.<br>
                                    We had a tiny intimate ceremony (only ourselves, our son, our two friends who were our witnesses, Angie and the photographer) and there were little things she did that just made it even more intimate, like stepping away during our vows and other key moments, leaving the two of us completely alone and fully in that moment together. It was beautiful. Angie, we are so grateful that you came into our lives. Thank you for everything, you are a wonderful person full of light and love, and a truly excellent celebrant. We would highly recommend you to anyone and everyone, as would our friends... they thought you were amazing as well! All the best, I am so excited for those who will have the pleasure of being married by you in the future... they will be lucky too!
